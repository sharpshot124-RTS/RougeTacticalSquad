Thank you for buying this model pack.

PBR environment.

Depending on your game engine/3D application you may need to rescale the models.



The mech model is rigged, skinned and animated. Please be aware that every game engine/3D application 
handles animations their own way. This can result in unexpected results. I cannot forsee every possible
compatibility issue that might arise.


The weapon models are unskinned, unrigged and have no animations. All firing animations you see in 
the video are made in the Unity game engine. Almost all 3D applications/game engines have their own 
built-in toolset for keyframe animations. Use this to create firing animations.
