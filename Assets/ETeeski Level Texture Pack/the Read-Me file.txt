Thank you for purchasing the ETeeski Level Texture Pack!


This packacge includes 100 textures. Every texture is in .jpg format and has a resolution of 2048 x 2048.

These textures are organized into four groups: industrial, inerior, nature, and war zone. Each texture is uniquly named with a few words to describe the texture. For every texture, there is a material with the same name. The textures and materials of each category are organized into a "textures" folder and a "materials" folder.

Some of these texture use the "general reflection cubemap". This cubemap and texture are shared between multiple materials.

These textures were made from digital photographs.

Three of these textures are piles of leaves and require the Transparent Cut-Out Diffuse shader. The texture file for these are in .png. Typically you would want to use these textures by applying them to a 2d plane and placing that plane slightly above the ground or other surface.
